        <h1>Return Tickets</h1>
        <p>
            If you have not yet completed the purchase of a ticket, you may return it to the ticket pool. If you have completed 
            the payment then you cannot return tickets but you may exchange them with another person. Exchanged tickets will be 
            included as part of your ticket count, therefore if you have purchased the maximum number of tickets you cannot then 
            purchase more by reassigning your original purchase to a third party. Returning tickets will decrement your ticket 
            count, so you may then repurchase the tickets at a later date.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            If you are sure you want to return the selected ticket then click the "Return Ticket" button below. Note that once you 
            have returned the ticket you cannot then re-acquire it without going back through the full purchase process.
        </p>
		
		<p>
            <strong>If you return your own ticket, then all of your guest tickets will automatically be returned as well</strong> 
            as you must have a ticket of your own in order to purchase or hold guest tickets.
        </p>
