        <h1>Setup Ticketing</h1>
        <br />
        <h3>Welcome</h3>
		<p>
            Welcome to your new ticketing system! Currently nothing is setup, so your first task is to setup the system. We need to do a few bits of automated configuration first and then you will need to put in some event details, a password for your account and a few other settings. If you're ready, click 'Get Started' and we'll do all the automated bits of the configuration first.
        </p>
